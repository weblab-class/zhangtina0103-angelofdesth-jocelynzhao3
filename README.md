## Note:

This branch does not implement gameState and socketing,
but API calls, authentication, and language type checking are all implemented.

## How to run this skeleton

First, 'npm install'
Then open two separate terminals, and 'npm run dev' in the first, and 'npm start' in the second.
Then open http://localhost:5173

## Socket stuff

Note: we'll be getting to this in lecture in week 2, so don't worry if you don't know it yet

- If you're not using realtime updating or don't need server->client communication, you can remove socket entirely! (server-socket.js, client-socket.js, and anything that imports them)
- If you are using sockets, consider what you want to do with the FIXME in server-socket.js

## Edit at your own risk

the following files students do not need to edit. feel free to read them if you would like.

```
client/src/utilities.js
client/src/client-socket.js
server/validator.js
server/server-socket.js
.npmrc
.prettierrc
package-lock.json
vite.config.js
```

## Good luck on your project :)
